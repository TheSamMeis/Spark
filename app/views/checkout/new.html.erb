	<h2 style='margin-top: 60px;'> If you were able to unlock the entrepreneurial talents of your team, what would that mean?  </h2>
	<p> 
		It would mean unlocking infinite potential of your hygienists,assistants, and associates. You'd have a flexible team who would not only cooperate, but also co-lead and co-create. You've been trying to lead your team in the direction of success, but you've been without the tools to unlock their entrepreneurial potential. 
	</p>

	<p>
		You tell your hygienists to offer fluoride to adults and help them accept the care, but this often times does not get done. Imagine you have successfully identified and nurtured the entrepreneurial traits in one hygienist. This hygienist feels confident in her ability to sell and is motivated to help the patient accept the care. Not only that, she comes up with a new, better way to sell the patient on the fluoride treatment, and spreads it to your other team members who are also united on the same mission.
	</p>	 
	<h2> What does this mean for your practice and your patients? </h2>
	
<div id="patient-benefits">
 	</div>
	<p>
 	 	Having entrepreneurs on your team means better patient care and increased revenue. It all comes down to one thing: The only way your practice is going to do better is to focus on better patient care.  
 	</p>


	<p>
		What if your hygienist could sell just one more fluoride treatment a day? What if your assistant could get one more patient per day to accept treatment for a crown? 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<strong>Crowns</strong> $1000 x 200 working days = $200,000 per assistant
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>Fluoride</strong> $30 X 200 working days = $6,000 per hygienist 
	</p>
	<p>
		How many assistants and hygienists do you have? If you're the average practice, you have two hygienists and two assistants. Thats almost $500,000 extra your practice could be making per year! All you need is the tools to spark entrepreneurship in your team.
